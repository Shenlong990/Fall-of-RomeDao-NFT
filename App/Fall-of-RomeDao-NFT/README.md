# Fall-of-RomeDao-NFT
WELCOME TO THE FALL OF ROME

Just a fun Sunday Dev project to create a momento by which holders can remember the days when Rome fell. 

ROMEDAO started as an OlympusDAO fork on the moonriver chain. They launched into peak bull market rebase token hype, managing to raise 8 figures in stablecoins to build the best P2E game they could, whilst providing holders with insane yields from that treasury. 

As is the case in the cryptoverse, the good times did not last long, with the MOVR chain repeatedly failing, the bridge liquidity drying up, and the market nosediving. The cracks began to show. 

Recently, the vote was passed to dissolve the treasury and return a proportional share to all ROME holders, following a hostile take over by so-called "Risk free value hunters". These whales seek out undervalued protcols and buy up governance tokens well below native asset value, and conspire to distribute treasuries. The list of projects gone that way now stands in the double digits, the most famous of which being Wonderland's WMEMO coin. 

Following my own lucky participation in the ROME whitelist, making a healthy profit, I settled in to enjoy the ride, the moonbag rapidly became a doombag and i rekt myself buying some dips, but I always thought ROME had the potential to hit between 500-1 bil market cap. I'd made some artwork for my office inspired by Roman themes following the ROMEDAO content stream, and decided, on hearing of the liquidation vote sucess, to share that with other holders for free. This repo contains that project. 

Gloria Victus.

Shout out to DeveloperDao for getting me interested in web3 dev. https://github.com/Developer-DAO

If i ever build a serious project, ROME holders will likely be Allowlisted. 

Thanks, Shen.
